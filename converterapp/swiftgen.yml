# In case your config entries all use a common input/output parent directory, you can specify those here.
#   Every input/output paths in the rest of the config will then be expressed relative to these.
#   Those two top-level keys are optional and default to "." (the directory of the config file).



# Generate constants for your localized strings.
#   Be sure that SwiftGen only parses ONE locale (typically Base.lproj, or en.lproj, or whichever your development region is); otherwise it will generate the same keys multiple times.
#   SwiftGen will parse all `.strings` files found in that folder.
